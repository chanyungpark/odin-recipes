    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt (made with whole milk, at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves (finely minced)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons vinegar (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or red pepper flakes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a small mixing bowl, combine the room-temp yogurt and garlic, a good pinch of kosher salt and whisk well. Divide the yogurt mixture between two serving bowls and set aside for now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a medium saucepan full of water to a boil. Stir in the vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, crack an egg into a small fine mesh sieve over a small bowl. Gently swirl the eggs in the sieve to drain the liquidy part of the egg whites (this gives you a neater-looking poached egg). Transfer the egg to a ramekin.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the water is ready, using a wooden spoon, stir the water to create a vortex. Quickly add the egg to the middle of vortex and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. When ready, using a slotted spoon, transfer the egg to a plate that’s been lined with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare and cook the second egg exactly as you did the first.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the second egg is cooking, quickly make the olive oil sauce. In a small skillet, warm the olive oil and Aleppo pepper over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Immediately transfer the poached eggs to the prepared yogurt bowls (simply place each egg on top of the yogurt mixture) and drizzle with the heated oil.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite rustic bread.</li>
    </ol>
